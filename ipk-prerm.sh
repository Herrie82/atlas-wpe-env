# Kill the HELPER DAEMONS too, not just BrowserServer. The boot wrapper backgrounds qcamd/qspkd/qmicd
# and then execs BrowserServer-atlas, so they are its children — and when BS dies without reaping them
# (the deadlock watchdog's abort, a kill -9, an upstart respawn) they re-parent to init and keep running
# forever. The wrapper is fine with that (it skips a helper that is already up), but an UNINSTALL is not:
#
#   /media/cryptofs is FUSE. Unlinking a file that some process still has open does not remove it — the
#   filesystem renames it to .fuse_hiddenXXXXXXXX and keeps it until the last holder closes it. A helper
#   left running holds its own binary and the engine libs open, so the installer's `rm -rf` of the app
#   directory silently leaves those files behind and then cannot remove the directories containing them:
#       rm: can't remove '.../deviceroot/atlas': Directory not empty
#       rm: can't remove '.../deviceroot/wpe-252/lib': Directory not empty
#   What the user is left with is an app folder holding an empty deviceroot skeleton — no app, no icon —
#   and the next install unpacks on top of it. Observed on-device 2026-08-23.
#
# So: TERM everything, give it a moment, then KILL whatever ignored that.
